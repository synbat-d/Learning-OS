# OSTEP Practice and Simulations

This repository contains my practice work and small experiments inspired by the book **_Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)_** by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau.

The goal of this repository is to better understand core operating systems concepts by implementing or simulating selected problems and homework exercises from the book.

---

## 📘 Overview

Most of the exercises here were implemented while I was reading through the OSTEP chapters.  
Some code is adapted from or based on the official OSTEP homework materials available on the authors’ GitHub page, with my own implementations, modifications, or experiments.

Topics covered so far include:

- Process creation and scheduling  
- Memory virtualization basics  
- Paging and TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) simulation  
- Page replacement policies  
- Threads and concurrency (up to initial chapters)

## 🧠 Examples of Work

- **TLB Access Time Simulation** — measured and plotted average access time for different TLB hit/miss rates.  
- **Page Table Experiments** — simple experiments to understand how address translation works.  
- **Thread Basics** — basic threading exercises and context switching experiments.

## ⚙️ Environment

Most programs were written in **C** and tested on **Linux** (Ubuntu).  
Some plots and data visualizations were done in **Python** using `matplotlib`.

## 🧩 Note

This repository is **not** intended as a full solution set for OSTEP homework.  
It represents my personal learning process while studying the book, and is meant for educational and demonstration purposes only.
